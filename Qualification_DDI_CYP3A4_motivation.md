## Motivation 

This qualification report evaluates the predictive performance of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite to predict cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)-mediated drug-drug interactions. A PBPK model network of selected index CYP3A4 DDI perpetrators, covering the range from strong induction to strong inhibition, and respective sensitive index CYP3A4 victim drugs has been built and evaluated. All models are whole-body PBPK models, allowing for dynamic DDI assessment in organs expressing CYP3A4. 

The qualification report demonstrates the level of confidence of the OSP suite with regard to reliable PBPK predictions of CYP3A4-mediated DDIs by means of pre-specified qualification measures. The presented PBPK models as well as the respective qualification plan and qualification report are transparently documented and provided open-source [[1,2](#reference)].
